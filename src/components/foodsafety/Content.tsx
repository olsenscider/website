          <br /><Typography variant="body1">In studies on contaminated cider products in Canada, greatest sources of contamination were found to be grounded apples, especially when exposed to livestock, wilklife, or manure for fertilization. Some contamination was introduced by non-municipal well water use and poor apple washing, milling, and pressing practices.</Typography>
          <br /><Typography variant="body1">If you use hand-picked apples (not on the ground) and sort out rotten apples, the major sources of contamination are mitigated. If you culinary water source is municipal, risk of contamination from water is minimal. Olsen's Hometown Cider sanitizes its equipment before and after each pressing service. The majorly reduces risk of contamination. If there is still concern of cider contamination, you may heat your cider to 160 degrees Fhrenheit for at least 15 seconds to pasteurize the fresh cider before consumption.</Typography>
