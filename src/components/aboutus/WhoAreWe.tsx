            <br /><Typography variant="body1" >Olsen's Hometown Cider was founded by Kyler and Jessica Olsen (thatâ€™s us!). We were both raised in small towns here in Utah and enjoyed pressing apple cider as a fall family tradition. We both attended Utah State University (go Aggies!) and are happy to be living in the beautiful Cache Valley.</Typography>
            <br /><Typography variant="body1" >We started this business to bring our family traditions of pressing apple cider to other members of the Cache Valley community. While in college, Kyler built a cider press for his parents as a Christmas gift, and it quickly became a family passion. Our current cider press was custom built by Kyler and is ready to turn your apples into a delightful, autumn treat. We are excited to bring one of our favorite fall traditions to you and your family!</Typography>
